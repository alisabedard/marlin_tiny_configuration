Contributions to this project are accepted in the form of ideas and code.  
If a contribution relates to a specific set of hardware, it should be in its own header file,
to be included as an override of the defaults.  If an idea is helpful in the default
configuration set, it will be incorporated.  Help text should be in separate files in markdown syntax.
